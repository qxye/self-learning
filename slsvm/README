This code implements the soft-max latent SVM formulation in BMVC 2014 paper:
H. Bilen, M. Pedersoli, T. Tuytelaars. 
Weakly Supervised Object Detection with Posterior Regularization

Warning: The training code does not include the posteriors for symmetry and
mutual exclusion yet but only the soft-max latent SVM formulation. 

This code requires the optimization package from Mark Schmidt:
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc_2012.zip

To compile the code, run make

A toy example is given in run_example.m
